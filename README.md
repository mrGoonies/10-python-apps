# Junior/Trainee Python Developer Project

This repository contains various projects designed to help Junior or Trainee developers strengthen their Python skills, covering fundamentals to advanced concepts such as File I/O, classes, consuming external APIs, web scraping, and implementing Pythonic code. All these projects were inspired by the course [Python Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/python-language-jumpstart-building-10-apps).

## Repository Structure

- **hello-world:**
  - Folder covering basic Python concepts, such as variables, data types, functions and get data entered by user.

- **birthday-app**
  - Use of docstring and use of date management using the date library.

- **guess-that-number**
  - Use of control structure and use of native python libraries such as *random*.

- **daily-journal**
  - Import functions from other files.
  - Using File I/O correctly (automatic closing).

## Topics Learned
1. Enumerate: 
    - It is a built-in function that allows you to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) and obtain both the element and its index on each iteration. This eliminates the need to maintain a separate accountant.

2. Import features from other files correctly:
  - Use the word *import file_name* and access the functions of that file using the dot notation. This facilitates understanding and explicitness when reading and understanding code.

3. namedtuple:
  - Namedtuples facilitate access to the values of a tuple which makes the code more readable, since we access the values by their tag instead of being able to access the values by their location within the data structure.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- Additional dependencies are detailed in the `requirements.txt` files in each specific folder.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder you are interested in.
3. Follow the specific instructions for each project within their respective folders.
